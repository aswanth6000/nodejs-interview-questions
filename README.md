1. ### What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side and network applications. It is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, which powers the Google Chrome browser. Node.js enables the execution of JavaScript code on the server side, extending its use beyond web browsers.

## Key Features

   1. **Asynchronous and Event-Driven:**
   - Node.js handles asynchronous operations efficiently using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This allows developers to build scalable and performant applications that handle many concurrent connections.

   2. **Single-Threaded:**
   - Despite being single-threaded, Node.js uses an event loop to manage asynchronous operations without blocking the execution of other code. This design enables the development of highly responsive applications.

   3. **NPM (Node Package Manager):**
   - Node.js comes with npm, a package manager facilitating the installation, management, and sharing of third-party libraries and tools. The npm ecosystem is extensive, promoting code reuse and collaboration within the Node.js community.

   4. **Cross-Platform:**
   - Node.js is designed to run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a cross-platform technology.

   5. **Server-Side JavaScript:**
   - Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript on the server side, unifying the development language across the entire application stack. This can simplify development processes and promote consistency in code.

   6. **Large and Active Community:**
   - Node.js has a large and active community of developers contributing to the growth of the platform. The community support is evident in the availability of numerous libraries and frameworks that enhance Node.js development.

   7. **Versatility:**
   - Node.js is versatile and applicable for various types of applications, including web servers, APIs, microservices, real-time applications (e.g., chat applications, online gaming), and more.

Node.js is often used with frameworks like Express.js to simplify the process of building web applications. It has gained widespread popularity and is adopted by both small startups and large enterprises due to its performance, scalability, and effective handling of concurrent connections.

2. ### What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript?
   ## JavaScript vs Node.js

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a lightweight programming language, often referred to as a "scripting language." It is commonly used to develop interactive web pages, allowing developers to insert dynamic text into HTML elements. JavaScript is primarily known as the language of web browsers.

### Node.js

Node.js is not a programming language but rather an engine that provides a runtime environment to execute JavaScript code. Unlike JavaScript in the browser, Node.js is used to run JavaScript programs outside the browser, primarily on the server-side. It is not designed to handle HTML tags; instead, it is used for server-side code execution.

In summary, while JavaScript is a scripting language used for client-side web development, Node.js extends the use of JavaScript to the server-side, providing a runtime environment for running JavaScript code beyond the confines of the browser.

3. ### Is Node.js Single-Threaded?

Yes, Node.js is a single-threaded application as it is built using the single-threaded event loop model architecture.

4. ### What kind of API function is supported by Node.js

### Types of API Functions in Node.js

Node.js supports two types of API functions:

   **Synchronous:**
   - These API functions are used for blocking code, meaning they block the execution of the program until the operation is completed. They are suitable for performing lightweight tasks.

  **Asynchronous:**
   - These API functions are used for non-blocking code. They do not block the execution of the program, allowing each command to be executed after the previous one, even if the previous command has not completed. Asynchronous functions are typically used for performing heavy tasks.

5. ### What is the difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous Functions?

   **Synchronous Function:**
   - These functions block the execution of the program during an operation, also known as blocking operations. They are used for lightweight tasks.

   **Asynchronous Function:**
   - These functions do not block the execution of the program. Each command is executed after the previous one, even if the previous command has not computed the result. They are used for performing heavy tasks.

6. ### What is middleware?
   - Middleware is the function that works between the request and the response cycle. Middleware gets executed after the server receives the request and before the controller sends the response.

7. ### How Node.js handle concurrency?
   - Node js is an open-source virtual machine that uses javascript as its scripting language. Despite being single-threaded, it is one of the most popular web technologies. The reason why node js is popular despite being single-threaded is the asynchronous nature that makes it possible to handle concurrency and perform multiple I/O operations at the same time. Node js uses an event loop to maintain concurrency and perform non-blocking I/O operations.

As soon as Node js starts, it initializes an event loop. The event loop works on a queue (which is called an event queue) and performs tasks in FIFO(First In First Out) order. It executes a task only when there is no ongoing task in the call stack. The call stack works in LIFO(Last In First Out) order. The event loop continuously checks the call stack to check if there is any task that needs to be run. Now whenever the event loop finds any function, it adds it to the stack and runs in order.

8. ### What do you mean by event loop in Node.js?
   -Event Loop in Node.js is used to handle callbacks. It is helpful in performing non-blocking I/O operations. An event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them, and then sleeps until it receives more tasks.

9. ### What is the order in which control flow statements get executed?
    - ### The order in which the statements are executed is as follows:

   - Execution and queue handling
   - Collection of data and storing it
   - Handling concurrency
   - Executing the next lines of code

10. ### What are the main disadvantages of Node.js?
- Since Node.js is single-threaded so multi-threaded engines are better and can handle tasks more efficiently. Also, we do not use relational databases with Node.js like MySQL mostly non-relational databases like MongoDB is used.

15. ### What are promises in Node.js?
    - A promise is basically an advancement of callbacks in NodeJS. In other words, a promise is a JavaScript object which is used to handle all the asynchronous data operations. While developing an application you may encounter that you are using a lot of nested callback functions which causes a problem of callback hell. Promises solve this problem of callback hell.

16. ### What is event-driven programming in Node.js?
    -  Event-driven programming is used to synchronize the occurrence of multiple events and to make the program as simple as possible. The basic components of an Event-Driven Program are:

- A callback function ( called an event handler) is called when an event is triggered.
- An event loop that listens for event triggers and calls the corresponding event handler for that event.

17. ### What is buffer in Node.js?
    - The Buffer class in Node.js is used to perform operations on raw binary data. Generally, Buffer refers to the particular memory location in memory. Buffer and array have some similarities, but the difference is array can be any type, and it can be resizable. Buffers only deal with binary data, and it can not be resizable. Each integer in a buffer represents a byte. console.log() function is used to print the Buffer instance.

18. ### What are streams in Node.js?
- Streams are a type of data-handling method and are used to read or write input into output sequentially. Streams are used to handle reading/writing files or exchanging information in an efficient way. The stream module provides an API for implementing the stream interface. Examples of the stream object in Node.js can be a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

19. ### Explain crypto module in Node.js?
    -The crypto module is used for encrypting, decrypting, or hashing any type of data. This encryption and decryption basically help to secure and add a layer of authentication to the data. The main use case of the crypto module is to convert the plain readable text to an encrypted format and decrypt it when required.

20. ### What is callback hell?
   - Callback hell is an issue caused due to a nested callback. This causes the code to look like a pyramid and makes it unable to read To overcome this situation we use promises.
